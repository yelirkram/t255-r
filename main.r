# Suggestions to change
# 1. Add or change the activities in the vector
# 2. Print out the values in some of the variables in the function to see what they are
# 3. Change the while loop to check that the value does not equal y
# 4. Change so that two activities are selected and ask the user if they like both (advanced)
